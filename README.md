This project contains Python scripts for analyzing financial data (PyBank) and election results (PyPoll). PyBank calculates metrics such as total months, net total profits/losses, and identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits. PyPoll determines the total number of votes cast, the percentage of votes each candidate won, and the overall election winner. To use the scripts, ensure Python is installed, clone the repository, and run the main.py script in the respective directory. Contributions are welcome, and the project is licensed under the MIT License.
